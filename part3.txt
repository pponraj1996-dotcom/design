An IC engine (Internal Combustion Engine) is a heat engine where fuel burns inside the engine itself to produce power. The combustion (burning) happens inside a small chamber called the cylinder, and the energy released pushes a piston, which ultimately turns the wheels of a vehicle or runs machinery.

IC engines are used in:

Cars

Motorcycles

Trucks
